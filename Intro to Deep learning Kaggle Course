Single Neuron:

Single neuron models are linear models ( y= wx+b)
Linear units in Keras : using keras.Sequential, we can create neural network as a stack of layers.


from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
model= keras.Sequential([layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[3])])

the first argument, units, is how many outputs we want

Keras represents weights as tensors. Tensors are basically Tensorflow's version of Numpy arrays, but with some differences.

A model's weights are kept in its 'weights' attribute as a list of tensors.

Keras also uses tensors for representing data. If input_shape=3, it means network will be created, that expects vectors of length 3, like [0.2,0.4,0.7]
